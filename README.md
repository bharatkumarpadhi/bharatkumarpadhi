#Steps to be followed for any Research
1. Import  libraries
2. Load the Dataset
3. Data Exploration
     .Identify Variable and its role in the dataset 
     . Go for Univeriate and Bi-Variable analysis.
     .Univariate analysis: 
        .For continuous variables, build box plots or histograms for each variable independently. 
        .For categorical variables,build bar charts to show the frequencies
     .Bi-variable analysis - determine the interaction between variables by building visualization tools
        . For Continuous and Continuous data, go for scatter plots to analysis the data
        . For Categorical and Categorical data, go for stacked column chart to analysis the data
        . For Categorical and Continuous, go for boxplots combined with swarmplots to analysis the data
     .Find out:
        .Missing values and treat them.
        .Outliers and treat them.
      .Remove duplicate values of a variable
4. Data Preprocessing
    . Aggregation
    . Sampling
    . Dimensionality Reduction
    . Feature Subset Selection
    . Feature Creation
    . Discretization and Binarization
    . Variable Transformation
5. Algorithm applied
6. Result Analysis & Evaluation
